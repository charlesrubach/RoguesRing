Rogue's Pebble

Rogue's Pebble features cryptic hieroglyphs that provide crib notes for 24+ different Scam School effects.  No matter what room you're in, no matter what kind of crowd you're faced with, you'll have your cheat-sheet to perform some of the best tricks you've learned over the last 5 years of Scam School episodes.

For more information on the different hieroglyphs watch this video: http://youtu.be/qQ5V3gGvmC4

How to use:

1) Watch the video to familiarize yourself with the hieroglyphs. If you need further explanation follow the links under the video to learn more about the effects.

2) Check the app when at a bar to remind yourself what to do. If you get stuck press the select button to see more   information on the selected effect.

3) Enjoy your free beer!

This project is open source. If you find a better watch to do things please let me know! I'm still learning.
